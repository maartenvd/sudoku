A fast NxM sudoku solver

It is invoked using
./sudokuSolver <sudoku>

An unknown number is represented by a symbol out of the 1-9
range but it is recommended to use either dots or zeros.

Thanks to Timon Gehr for his idea of representing possibilities using 
bits and thanks to bearophile for cleaning up my code and supplying 
several idea's including the maxArray inlined range to increase 
performance.

Example:
./sudokuSolver 4.....8.5.3..........7......2.....6.....8.4......1.......6.3.7.5..2.....1.4......
